Design notes on B-Control OSC address space:

Probably best to use paths related to physical layout of controller. The
.ReaperOSC files make clear the purpose, and mapping to the paths that emphasize
the physical layout will make design of that file most intuitive.

Using terminology from the Behringer docs where applicable.

# Metadata

Maybe. Still thinking about this. Requires statefulness, or expensive queries to
derive each time.

OSC pattern                 range
/push-encoder/count         [1-32]
/key/count                  16
/user/count                 4
/group/count                {1,2,4}
/footswitch/count           [1-2]

# Buttons

Function keys have BCL control numbers 53-56, but don't send or receive data.

OSC pattern                          BCL#
/push-encoder/[1-32]/button           1-32   egroup range varies
/key/[1-16]                          33-48  
/user/[1-4]                          49-52  button group lower right
/group/[1-4]                         57-60  available based on egroups #
/footswitch/[1-2]                    61-62  BCF has only one

# Encoders

OSC pattern                          BCL#
/push-encoder/[1-32]/encoder          1-32   egroup range varies
/encoder/[1-24]                      33-56   BCR only

# Faders
/fader/[1-9]                          0-8    BCF only, 9 is foot input


rosc has a Matcher class, but it's not very well thought out. You can only ask a
Matcher if a given address matches its pattern; you get no information about the
varying matched parts. Seems smarter to translate patterns to regexes.

Patterns arrive in messages.
